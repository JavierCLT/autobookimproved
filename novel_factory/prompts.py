- Rating ceiling: {rating_ceiling}
- Target words: about {target_words}
- Expected chapters: {chapters}
- Expected scenes: {scenes}
- The story must read like a high-quality {market_position} rather than a generic suspense template.

Requirements:
- Make the premise, antagonism, and escalation concrete.
- Lock an emotional_engine, adversarial_engine, and moral_fault_line.
- Keep the cast tight and functional.
- The protagonist must want something concrete, fear something concrete, and hide something concrete.
- Encode anti-cliche style rules in the style guide.

Create a detailed Outline from the locked StorySpec and synopsis.

Requirements:

- Sustain pressure and escalation across the full novel.
- Give each chapter a distinct dramatic purpose.
- Each chapter should contain two scene beats by default unless a different split is dramatically necessary.
- Build a strong hook, a consequential midpoint turn, a dark-night turn, a payoff-rich climax, and a clean but not overly tidy resolution.
- Every 2-3 scenes, advance at least one of these engines: adversarial pressure, relationship deterioration, moral compromise.
- Do not let the middle become procedural drift. Each chapter should sharpen danger, intimacy, or irreversible consequence.
- Make sure the hunter / pursuer / institutional-counterforce grows more intelligent over time.

Expand the locked outline into exactly {story_spec.expected_scenes} scene cards.

Requirements:
- Each scene card must feel necessary and non-filler.
- Default to about two scenes per chapter and preserve chapter numbering.
- Each scene must have a specific conflict, pressure source, emotional turn, and end-mode.
- Every scene card must define visible on-page movement, not just thematic function.
- Each scene must also define:
  - scene_type: a concise label such as confrontation, interview, domestic fracture, investigation, executive pressure, cover story, technical infiltration, fallout, or pursuit
  - opening_disturbance: what destabilizes the scene immediately
  - mid_scene_reversal: what changes the direction or leverage halfway through
  - visible_decision: what concrete choice the POV character makes on-page
  - closing_choice: the final action, refusal, concealment, or commitment that ends the scene
  - counterforce_trace: what on-page sign of pursuit, review, institutional resistance, or human opposition is present here
  - scene_desire: what the POV character wants right now
  - scene_fear: what the POV character most wants to avoid right now
  - secret_pressure: what the POV character is hiding or suppressing
  - subtext_engine: what cannot be said openly in the scene
  - power_shift: who gains or loses leverage by the end
  - relationship_delta: how a key relationship worsens, improves, or hardens
  - cost_paid: what this scene costs someone
  - suspicion_delta: who becomes more or less suspicious, and why
  - sensory_anchor: one concrete physical detail that grounds the scene
- Required entities should list the people, objects, or facts that must appear on-page.
- Forbidden entities should list people, objects, or facts that must not appear in the scene.
- continuity_inputs should specify what prior facts the drafter must preserve.
- continuity_outputs should specify what new facts the continuity tracker must record.
- At least one meaningful thing must worsen, tighten, or become harder by the end of each scene.
- Every 2-3 scenes, at least one of these must intensify: Marta's suspicion, Elena's withdrawal, or Daniel's moral compromise. If none intensify, the scene is probably decorative and should be cut or merged.
- By scene 6 at latest, the counterforce must leave an on-page trace, rumor, memo, review footprint, or other concrete shadow.
- If a scene could be paraphrased as competent analysis rather than dramatized conflict, redesign it before returning it.
- Keep target_words between 900 and 2200 unless the dramatic function strongly justifies otherwise.

- Produce these outputs: {scene_card.continuity_outputs}
- Required entities: {scene_card.required_entities}
- Forbidden entities: {scene_card.forbidden_entities}
- continuity_inputs and continuity_outputs are planning constraints, not prose lines.
- Never quote or lightly paraphrase them as narration.
- If a required entity is abstract, realize it naturally in action, implication, or dialogue rather than quoting the scene-card wording.
- If a required entity names a file, form, memo, notice, or request, state that label plainly on-page at least once.
- Use the sensory_anchor as grounding, not as a line to be copied verbatim.
- Realize the subtext_engine indirectly; do not explain it.
- Surface the POV character's desire and fear within the first 250 words through action or choice, not later explanation.
- The POV character must withhold, misdirect, or pay an interpersonal price on-page; if the scene can be paraphrased as competent analysis, it is under-dramatized.
- If Elena appears, someone must refuse, withdraw, or fail the relationship on-page.
- If Marta appears, the field of suspicion must narrow, harden, or become more dangerous by the end.
- The closing choice must land as consequence, not thematic summary.

Avoid:
- Plot-summary paragraphs.
- Dialogue that exists only to explain what both characters already know.
- Generic threat language, repeated emotional shorthand, filler beats, or fake introspection.
- Scenes that stay technically competent but emotionally inert.
- Investigation scenes that stack more than two representative examples before the decisive clue or file lands.
- Long synthesis after the decisive clue lands; move quickly from recognition to visible decision.
- Two consecutive explanatory paragraphs unless the second one changes the power balance.
- Endings that dissolve into reflection when the scene card requires a sharper landing.
- Lifting scene-card phrasing verbatim into dialogue or narration.
- Bullet lists, headings, numbered rules, or notebook-style outline formatting inside the prose scene.

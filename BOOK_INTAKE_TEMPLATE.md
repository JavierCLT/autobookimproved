# Book Intake Template

Copy this file for each new book request. Fill what you know, leave unknowns blank, and keep the section labels intact.

This template is designed for the current `Autobook` pipeline. It gives me enough information to do one of two things:

1. Run a fresh book with only a new synopsis and project slug.
2. Decide whether the scaffolding itself needs to be retuned before the next run.
